# MIMO Benchmark:

This benchmark suite is fully self generated.

## Benchmark format
The benchmark has three main parts:
<ol>
    <li> The setup part: all the needed information (QAM scheme, amount of users and antennas) is shown here,</li>
    <li> The transfer function: described by the real and imaginary part, and </li>
    <li> The send out signals x. </li>
</ol>

## Best known values
All the MU-MIMO benchmarks have as minimum zero. This is because the problem is set up as a least square problem.
