# â™œ Application Benchmarks

This folder contains the benchmark suites for different applications:

- **Gset MaxCut:** Partition the vertices of a graph into two sets to maximize the sum of weights of edges crossing the sets.
- **BiqMac:** a collection of binary/multi-bit MaxCut instances and multi-bit quadratic problems.
- **TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem):** Find the shortest possible tour that visits each city once and returns to the start.
- **ATSP (Asymmetric TSP):** Like TSP, but the distance from city A to B may differ from B to A.
- **Knapsack:** Find the set of items that fit in the knapsack with maximum profit.
- **MIMO:** Find the send out symbols x from the received symbols y given the transfer matrix. The problem is dependent on the modulation scheme being used (here M-QAM) and the SNR.
- **ImageCut:** TBD
- **IntFactoring:** TBD
- **Sudoku:** TBD
- **POLAR:** TBD
- **LDPC:** TBD
