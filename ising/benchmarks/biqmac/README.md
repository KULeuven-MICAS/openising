# Multi-bit Quadratic Benchmark: BiqMac

This folder contains the [BiqMac](https://biqmac.aau.at/biqmaclib.html) benchmark suite (created in year 2007), which contains five collections:

- **beasley:** Beasley instances (multi-bit weights).

- **gka:** Glover, Kochenberger and Alidaee instances (multi-bit weights).

- **be:** Billionnet and Elloumi instances (multi-bit weights).

- **rudy:** MaxCut (binary weights) instances generated with rudy.

- **ising:** MaxCut (multi-bit weights) instances from applications in statistical physics (generated by Frauke Liers).

For each instance, the text file is in the following format (same as Gset):

```pseudo-code
N E
i0 j0 w_i0j0
i1 j1 w_i1j1
i2 j2 w_i2j2
```

The first row lists the number of vertices N and edges E, while following rows list the edges one edge per row. Each such row contains the edge's endpoint vertices i and j as well as its weight w_ij.

The file `biqmaclib.pdf` contains the detailed description for the BiqMac benchmark suite, which is copied from the [source repository](https://biqmac.aau.at/biqmaclib.html).

The detailed information and the best known values are provided in each separate folder.
